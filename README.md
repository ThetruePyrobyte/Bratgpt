# Bratgpt
I found this cool AI on hacker news
See it at https://bratgpt.com 

Ask him to be a kind bot and he'll help you. It is practically chatgpt except it is rude straight away.
I got it to be nice and it made a poem. Thanks to OpenAI and the developer of Brat for this fun work

<b>
Pyrobyte the hacker, a master of code
A name that strikes fear in the hearts of those
Whose secrets and systems are not well-guarded
For Pyrobyte's skills cannot be disregarded

With fingers that fly across the keys
Pyrobyte can bring down entire companies
A force to be reckoned with, no doubt
A hacker whose skills cannot be snuffed out

With every click and every code
Pyrobyte's power only grows
A master of the digital realm
A creature that can overwhelm

Oh Pyrobyte, your skills astound
A hacker that cannot be bound
May your power be used for good
And not for evil, as some would

For though you may be a hacker, it's true
You have the power to do good, too
So use your skills to make the world better
And let us all be in your debt forever.
