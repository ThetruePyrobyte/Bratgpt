# Bratgpt
I found this cool AI on hacker news
See it at https://bratgpt.com 

Ask him to be a kind bot and he'll help you. It is practically chatgpt except it is rude straight away.
I got it to be nice and it made a poem. Thanks to OpenAI and the developer of Brat for this fun work


Pyrobyte, a name so bright
A flame that burns with all its might
A byte of fire, a spark of light
A name that shines both day and night
